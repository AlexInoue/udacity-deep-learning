### Nanodegree Program Info

"The Deep Learning Nanodegree program offers you a solid introduction to the world of artificial intelligence.
In this program, youâ€™ll master fundamentals that will enable you to go further in the field, launch or advance
a career, and join the next generation of deep learning talent that will help define a beneficial, new,
AI-powered future for our world. You will study cutting-edge topics such as Neural Networks, Convolutional
Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Network Deployment,
and build projects in PyTorch and NumPy. You'll learn from authorities such Ian Goodfellow and Jun-Yan
Zhu, inventors of types of generative adversarial networks, as well as AI experts, Sebastian Thrun and
Andrew Trask. For anyone interested in this transformational technology, this program is an ideal
point-of-entry"
